### Head

### Industrial Tutor — Durham University (Engineering)
*Sep 2025 – Present | On‑site, part‑time*

I lead weekly project tutorials for undergraduate design teams and act as an industry mentor. The emphasis is on **quantitative decision‑making under constraints** and communicating engineering reasoning clearly.

### Body

**What I do**
- Guide teams through structured milestones: **Gantt planning, feasibility studies, design reviews**, and checkpoint retros.
- Mark feasibility and final submissions; deliver **objective, rubric‑based feedback** on clarity, rigour, assumptions, and justification.
- Coach teams to formalise vague ideas into **specifications**, run **back‑of‑the‑envelope estimates**, and make **sensitivity/constraint analyses** (cost, risk, performance).
- Encourage **evidence‑led iteration**: define pass/fail criteria up‑front, run simple tests, and **retire designs** that don’t meet constraints.
