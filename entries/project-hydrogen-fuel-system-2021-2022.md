### Hydrogen Fuel System for Gas Turbines — Year 2 Project  
*Team of 5; cryogenic storage, sensing, and safety systems for passenger jets*

**My focus**  
- Designed **leak detection** architecture and integrated **tank sensors** for temperature, pressure, and level monitoring.  
- Modelled **boil‑off** behaviour and contributed to **pressure compensation** systems for stable turbine feed.  

**Outcome**  
Concept validated against safety/operational constraints; delivered engineering report and presentations. Recieved 77% for the final project.
