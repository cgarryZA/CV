### Head

### Electronic Differential System for EVs — Year 3 Project  
*Team of 6; torque vectoring and cost‑reduced drivetrain architecture*

### Body

**What I did**  
- Designed **electronic differential** and **torque‑vectoring** concept to reduce mass and BOM vs. mechanical diffs.  
- Produced a **variable‑frequency drive** concept for per‑wheel motor control aligned to control algorithms.  
- Coordinated bi‑weekly technical meetings and progress reports.

**Outcome**  
Delivered feasibility study, control approach, and system design artifacts to the departmental design review.
