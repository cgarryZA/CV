### CS2/CS:GO Market Analytics & Trading Research  
*Pricing, liquidity, and execution across fragmented digital-asset venues (work in progress)*

Ongoing research project studying **pricing**, **liquidity**, and **market microstructure** across the major CS2/CS:GO marketplaces. The focus is on **clean ETL**, **fee/FX normalisation**, and **execution-aware backtests** that reflect realistic frictions.

**What I’m building**  
- **Unified data pipeline** → ingestion, validation, and **normalised dataset** for cross‑venue analysis.  
- **Indices & risk**: simple market baskets and factor-style metrics (e.g., **Sharpe**, **Sortino**) with **out‑of‑sample** checks.  
- **Execution-aware backtests**: slippage/fee models, fill simulation, and venue‑specific constraints.  
- **Diagnostics**: data quality dashboards, latency/trace logs, and reproducible research artefacts.

**Why it matters**  
Alternative digital markets exhibit **distinct microstructure** (thin books, event spikes, venue idiosyncrasies). This project emphasises **robust data plumbing**, **honest evaluation**, and **deployable code** over toy backtests.

> _This entry will be expanded with code links, dashboards, and a short paper once initial milestones are complete._
