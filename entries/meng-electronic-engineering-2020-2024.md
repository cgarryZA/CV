### MEng Electronic Engineering — Durham University  
*Awarded Jun 2024 (Upper Second-Class Honours; H711 Electronic Engineering pathway)*

Four-year integrated Masters covering **electronics, communications and embedded systems**, with strong mathematical and control foundations. Progressed from general engineering (Y1–Y2) to **electronic/electrical specialism** (Y3–Y4), culminating in an **individual MEng R&D project**.

**Selected modules (by year)**  
- **Year 1–2 (General Engineering core):** Mathematics for Engineers & Scientists; Thermodynamics & Fluid Mechanics; Solid Mechanics & Structures; Electronic & Electrical Systems; Engineering Practice; Engineering Mathematics 2; Mathematical Modelling & Computing 2; Probability, Statistics & Further Mathematical Methods; Electronics 2; Electrical Engineering 2; Engineering Design 2.  
- **Year 3 (Specialisation):** Digital Electronics & DSP; Electronics & Communications; Control & Signal Processing; Engineering Design 3; Electrical Engineering 3; Semiconductor Physics & Devices.  
- **Year 4 (Advanced electronics/communications):** Advanced Electronics; Radio & Digital Communications; Photonics; Communications Networks; Artificial Intelligence & Deep Learning; Advanced Electronics Measurements; **MEng Research & Development Project**.

**Why it matters**  
Built a toolkit that blends **rigorous maths**, **signal processing/communications**, and **hardware-aware software**—useful for both **HFT-style latency/throughput thinking** and robust production engineering.

**Highlights**  
- **MEng R&D Project:** _Silicon Carbide JFET CPU_ — custom 4‑bit architecture in LTspice with a bespoke C‑like compiler (C++), assembler, and Python PWL toolchain.  
- **Control/DSP:** classical & discrete-time techniques; real-time computing labs.  
- **Electronics CAD & measurements:** analogue/digital design, instrumentation, FPGA/VHDL exposure (Digital Systems).
