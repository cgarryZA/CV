### MSc Scientific Computing & Data Analysis (AI for Engineering) — Durham University  
*Started Sep 2025 (concurrent with role at Siemens, Durham, UK)*

I started the MSc in September 2025. My focus is on **statistical inference, optimisation, numerical linear algebra, and high-performance/GPU computing**, with an eye to writing numerically stable, production-grade code. I’m doing the degree alongside my work at Siemens, so I’m being disciplined with time-management and shipping work that’s useful.

**Modules (AI for Engineering stream)**  
- **Core:** Introduction to Machine Learning & Statistics; Introduction to Scientific & High-Performance Computing; Professional Skills; MISCADA Project.  
- **Specialisation:** Optimisation & Control for AI; Deep Learning for Engineering.  
- **Options (selection):** Advanced Statistical & ML (Foundations & Unsupervised); Advanced Statistics & ML (Regression & Classification); Performance Modelling, Vectorisation & GPU Programming.

**Why this matters**  
It formalises the tools I use at work and in personal research: probabilistic modelling, optimisation, and performance engineering—bridging **algorithmic rigour** with **deployable, efficient implementations**.

**What I’m aiming for**  
- **Uncertainty-aware** models and optimisation pipelines that hold up **out-of-sample** on real data streams.  
- **Performance-minded code** (vectorisation, CUDA/GPU) with profiling, numerical stability, and reproducible runs.  
- **Robust deployments:** tested, documented tooling that moves cleanly from research to production.  
- Bread-and-butter foundations reinforced: **Bayesian inference**, **supervised/unsupervised learning**, **stochastic modelling**, and **time-series-aware evaluation**.
